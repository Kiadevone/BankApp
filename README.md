## Project Focus

- Intensive utilization of advanced **JavaScript array methods** (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and more) to efficiently manage and transform data.
- Implementation of dynamic **UI updates driven by unidirectional data flow**, ensuring seamless synchronization between application state and interface.
- Development of a minimalist yet robust **login system** and **timer functionality** to handle user session states and time-based interactions.
- Demonstration of clean and modular **function composition and interaction**, illustrating best practices for maintainable and scalable code architecture.
